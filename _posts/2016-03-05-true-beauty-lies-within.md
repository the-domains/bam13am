# True Beauty Lies Within

We all have heard of this wonderful quote before, and I want to break it down, get deeper, and dissect what it really means to be beautiful from within, and what happens when you are? 

I can strongly agree that we are energetic beings. So this means that when you are beautiful from within, you are vibrating a different type of energy. Most people know this without knowing it. When you just don't like someone? that's because the energy isn't right. But it doesn't have to be just one way round. A person who sees ugly within people can dislike a very very attractive and beautiful person from within. This can be caused by judgments and just hatred for the self and others. 

Being beautiful from within means eventually, you will actually become physically beautiful. You can easily tell what someone is feeling or thinking by just feeling their energy, by the way their body is positioned and this all comes in a form of intuition. Our brains can actually detect the smallest evidence of a particular individual. Or a room full of people, it works in many different ways. 
 

Lets throw in some "facts" because for most, facts are important to them, so when you pick up a book on body language, we actually have parts of our brains that are signaling information about someone by the subtle body language that we don't usually pick up on. This is where intuition kicks in. Becuase women actually have more signals than men! So this explains why women play mind games and men don't get it. 

Our body language is effected from within, the way you think and the way you see the world. When you feel like a winner you look like a winner. Of course, you can fake it for awhile, but if you don't clean up your dusty realm of broken hearts and false promises, when you are caught in the midst of being busy, your subconscious brain kicks in and takes over your thoughts, words and actions. This is why the most beautiful girls are not able to hold down a man. They can only keep up a perfect image for so long. 

A perfect example is parenthood, the reason why so many mothers look stressed out and is depressed is because their inner child is shouting for their attention. When you are looking after a baby EVERYTHING goes out the window, everything is about.... the baby. But when you are trying to care and love and nurture this bundle of joy, and you can't even love yourself, what do you think happens? You get sad sick and stressed out. Your baby cries for no reason and we officially call being parents stressful and a "sacrifice" you have to make. It is what the society know it as. 

Look. If you wanna look effortless, in flow and like Audry Hepburn all the time, you gotta clean yourself up. 

You wouldn't drive, fly or ride anything that is broken. Then why are you dragging your broken ass everywhere making drama and a scene wherever you go? 

Stop blaming, stop pointing, stop bitching, stop, stop , stop. 
At least, slowdown. Just slow it down. Turn it down, and then stop and then go a different direction. 

ACTION STEP:
Everything comes from within, start looking after yourself. Just hold this mindset. "When I love myself, life is easier".
